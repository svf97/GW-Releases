## Workflows (AWS)

### Workflows Brief
- GW-Releases work with 3 main workflows
    - [icap-server](https://github.com/k8-proxy/GW-Releases/actions?query=workflow%3Aicap-server)
    - [proxy-rebuild](https://github.com/k8-proxy/GW-Releases/actions?query=workflow%3Aproxy-rebuild)
    - [k8-rebuild](https://github.com/k8-proxy/GW-Releases/actions?query=workflow%3Ak8-rebuild)
- Each commit made to the main branch triggers the workflow, but the following directories are ignored:
    - aws-jmeter-test-engine
    - gp-load-balancer
    - GW-proxy
    - s-k8-proxy-rebuild
    - k8-rebuild
    - .github/workflows/k8-rebuild.yaml
- There are 2 main jobs for each workflow:
    - build-ami
        - Configure AWS credentials
        - Setup Packer
        - Build AMI 

    ![build-ami](imgs/build-ami.png)
    
    - deploy-ami
        - Get current instance ID
        - Deploy AMI to dev
        - Run tests on instance
        - Delete instance(s) that fail

        - ICAP server IP
        - AWS region(s) where AMI will be created
        - IP of monitoring server
    - k8-rebuild
        - branch to use workflow from

### ICAP Server Workflow
